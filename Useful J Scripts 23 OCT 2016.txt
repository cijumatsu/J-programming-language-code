s is a boxed sentence of words
s =: ' ';'this';'is';'a';'sentence'

A sentence can be boxed from a list string like this
x =: ;: 'how cool is this'

Adding to sentence when boxing:
s,('this';'this';'and';'this')

Removes duplicated words
~. s 

Removes ‘is’ word from s
s -. <'is'

Add letter h to beginning of each word in s
’h’, each s

Add letter h to end of each word in s
s, each 'h'

Replace last letter of each word in s with h
(}: each s) ,each 'h'

Replace word with word usage: s replace ‘^’;’*’
replace =: 4 : 0
  old =. >0{y
  new =. >1{y
(<,new) (I. x = <,old)} x
)

Insert word into position 0 of s (replaces existing)
(<,’is') 0} s

Replace word at index  Usage: s replaceatindex 5;’word’
replaceatindex =: 4 : 0
  pos =. >0{y
  new =. >1{y
(<,new) pos} x
)

Insert word into position 4 of s (without replacing)
4 ({.,(<'sample'),}.) s

Dyadic implementation of above #Usage s insert 2;'haa'
insert =: 4 : 0
   position=. >0{y
   text=. >1{y
   position ({.,(<,text),}.) x
)

Take out sentence starting from 2 word (behead first 2 words)
2 }. s

Removes words 2 to 4 from sentence
(2 {. s), 4 }.s

Remove nth word from sentence
remove =: 4 : 0
   a=. y {. x
   b=. (y+1) }. x
   a,b
)

Find the position of the word in the sentence
(I. x = <'is')

Removes words between the characters ! and ?, the +1 means to also remove the ending ‘?’
x =: ;: 'how many words! does it take to? finish ha'
((I. x = <,'!') {. x), (1+ I. x = <,'?') }. x

Removes words between words ‘words’ and ‘finish’, the +1 means to also remove the beginning ‘words’
((1+I. x = <,’words’) {. x), (I. x = <,’finish’) }. x

Get everything before ^ 
((I. s = <,'^') {. s)

Get everything after $ 
(1+I. s = <,'$') }. s

Dyadic implementation of above #Usage: s allafter ‘word’
allafter =: 4 : 0
(1+I. x = <,y) }. x
)

Dyadic implementation of above #Usage: s allafter ‘word’
allbefore =: 4 : 0
((I. x = <,y) {. x)
)

Find words between ^ and $  #Usage: s between ‘^’;’$’ (works on unique words only, DOES NOT WORK if word repeats in sentence)

between =: 4 : 0
aft =: (1+I. x = <,>0{y) }. x
NB. bef =: (I. x = <,>1{y) {. x
(I. aft = <,>1{y) {. aft
)

Finds position of . character in string
string =:'"Linux use.rs group meets second? Wednesday> of each month."'
I. '.' = string

Finds position of word in boxed sentence Usage: s indexof 'the'
indexof =: 4 : 0
(1 I.@:> (<,y) I. x)
)

All possible permutations of a sentence
(i.!4) A. s

Is 'hundred' a word in the sentence
(;:'hundred') e. s
